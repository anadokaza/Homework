            <p class="description">

                I am Ana Dokaza, student at the Faculty of Computer Science and Engieneering.
                Passionate about travelling and fashion and ever since I was little I dreamed of visiting all the wordwide popular destinations.
                Therefore I created a page where I dedicate separate section for each of my hobbies.
                Iâ€™m so excited to share my favorite fashion pieces from well-known stores and places I have visited and are on my bucket list.
                <br><br>
                I believe that travelling broadens your horizon and leaves unforgettable memories. In my family there is a tradition of spending time together
                in a new city.
                <br>
                <br>
                I also love reading books by Jordan Peterson, one of the most influential people today and running, cause it is one way to stay in shape and disciplined.
